# Overview

The Prompt Settings section contains all tools for fine-tuning prompt behaviorâ€”from when and how often they appear to how their success is measured and variants tested.

# Key benefits

* **Centralized configuration**: Manage all prompt-level settings in one unified interface.
* **Granular control**: Precisely define trigger conditions, limits, and schedules for each prompt.
* **Data-driven optimization**: Set goals, attach actions, and run experiments to continuously improve performance.

# Key details

* **Triggers**: Define the events or conditions that fire prompts. ([Triggers](triggers))
* **Limits**: Configure per-prompt holdout, frequency caps, impression limits, and overlay intervals. ([Limits](limits))
* **Schedule**: Set start/end dates and time windows for prompt delivery. ([Schedule](schedule))
* **Goals**: Establish engagement or conversion goals to track prompt performance. ([Goals](goals))
* **Actions**: Attach API calls or analytics events to prompt interactions (impressions, clicks, dismissals). ([Actions](actions))
* **Experiments**: Create A/B tests to compare prompt variations and optimize results. ([Experiments](experiments))
* **Default prompt sizes**: Define standard dimensions for prompts across web, mobile, and CTV. ([Default prompt sizes](default-prompt-sizes))
