# Overview

The **Pulse Users** page lets you invite new users, assign roles, and control access to your Pulse application.

### Required plan

This feature or setting is available to all customers on any Recurly Engage subscription plan.

### Prerequisites & limitations

* You must have **Company Admin** or **App Admin** permissions to invite or manage users.

# Key benefits

* **Collaborative management**: Enable team members to create and manage prompts, segments, and guides based on their role.
* **Security**: Restrict settings and administrative actions to only those with appropriate permissions.

# Key details

Use the **Settings > Users** page to invite new users and update existing user permissions.
