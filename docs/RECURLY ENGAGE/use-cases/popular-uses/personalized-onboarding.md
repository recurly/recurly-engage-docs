# Overview

### Prerequisites & limitations

* You must have **Company**, **App Administrator**, or **App Member** permissions in Recurly Engage.

# Definition

Traditional onboarding tours interrupt the user flow with step-by-step callouts. The **Personalized Onboarding** Journey guide delivers prompts only for actions or sections the user hasnâ€™t yet seenâ€”and can span multiple visitsâ€”for a frictionless, contextual experience.

# Key benefits

* **Contextual guidance**: Show prompts only for features the user hasnâ€™t accessed.
* **Multi-visit flexibility**: Space your onboarding steps across sessions to avoid overload.
* **Higher engagement**: Streamlined education that respects the userâ€™s flow.

# Key details

Traditional approaches to onboarding new users include a step-by-step homepage tour with highlighted callouts to various features. This method may work for B2B, but B2C users often find it disruptive.

Recurly Engageâ€™s Journey guide lets you predefine a sequence of prompts linked to key site elements. Each prompt fires only if the user hasnâ€™t completed the associated action, and you can schedule them over multiple visitsâ€”resulting in a more user-friendly onboarding flow.

> Create usage trackers for your key features and content, then reference those trackers in your onboarding guide to target only first-time interactions.

## Guide

1. **Create** a new Guide (Settings > Guides) and **set** the type to **Journey**.
2. **Configure** the first prompt as a **Popup** targeting first-time visitors.
3. **Set** the CTA on that prompt to either trigger the feature directly (1-Click) or **redirect** to the relevant page.
4. **Add** a second prompt in the guide and schedule it for the userâ€™s next visit.
5. **Add** a third prompt scheduled for a subsequent visit as needed.
6. **Target** the guide to the **Test Users** segment.
7. **Specify** the trigger conditions (e.g., specific page URLs or tracker events).
8. **Start** the Guide.
9. **Add** your User ID to **Test Users** (Settings > Users > Test Users).
10. **Verify** that each prompt appears in the correct order across visits.
