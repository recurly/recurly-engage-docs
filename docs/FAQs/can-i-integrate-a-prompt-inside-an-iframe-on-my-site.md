# How can I trigger a prompt from inside an iFrame?

Load the Recurly Engage SDK only on your parent page and have it listen for `postMessage` events. In your child iFrame, send a message formatted as `"rf_prompt_<PROMPT_ID>"` to the parent windowâ€”Recurly Engage will intercept it and display the corresponding prompt.

In your iFrameâ€™s HTML/JS, attach a click handler that sends the prompt ID to the parent. Replace `66bc51c0-9829-4c4a-8697-223d0fff860a` with your own prompt UUID:

```html
<button onclick="postSubmitPayment()">Submit Payment</button>

<script>
  function postSubmitPayment() {
    parent.postMessage("rf_prompt_66bc51c0-9829-4c4a-8697-223d0fff860a", "*");
  }
</script>
```

Once the SDK on the parent page receives that message, it will open the specified prompt just as if it were triggered natively. You can call `postMessage` as many times as needed; all user interactions (accept, decline, dismiss) will function normally.
