# Overview

The **Evergent** integration lets you synchronize subscriber data and trigger subscription management actions from within Recurly Engage prompts by connecting to your Evergent REST API.

### Required plan

This feature or setting is available to all customers on any Recurly Engage subscription plan.

### Prerequisites & limitations

* Company or App Administrator permissions in Recurly Engage.
* Uses the Evergent REST API; legacy SOAP-only setups may require Customer Success assistance.

# Definition

# Key benefits

* **Real-time subscriber data**: Import detailed subscription traits for precise segment targeting.
* **Seamless subscription control**: Execute subscription actions (pause, resume, change service) directly from prompts.
* **Customizable workflows**: Tailor actions to your Evergent instance and business logic.

# Key details
