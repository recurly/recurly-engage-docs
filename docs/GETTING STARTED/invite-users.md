# Definition

Inviting users lets administrators grant team members access to specific applications in Recurly Engage and control what actions they can perform based on their permission level.

# Key benefits

* **Granular access control**: Assign precise permissions per user and per app to maintain security and accountability.
* **Streamlined onboarding**: Send invitations directly from the console for fast user setup.
* **Flexible team management**: Easily grant or revoke access across multiple apps without additional accounts.

# Key details

Administrators can invite users to individual apps in Recurly Engage. To grant a user access to multiple apps, send a separate invitation for each one. Only company or app administrators have the ability to modify settings and invite users.

To add a user:

1. In the Recurly Engage console, **go** to **Settings > Users** and **click** **Add user**.
