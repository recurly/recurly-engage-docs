# Overview

This page walks you through setting up your application in the Recurly Engage console. You’ll learn how to give your app a clear name, register the domain where it’s hosted, and—if needed—manage multiple domain aliases for unified control.

### Prerequisites & limitations

* You need **Administrator** access to configure your Recurly Engage account.

# Definition

An **application** in Recurly Engage is the container for your integration: it holds your app’s name, its primary domain, and any additional domains you want to manage under one console.

# Key benefits

* **Centralized management**: Define and update your app’s settings from a single, intuitive console.
* **Flexible branding**: Use domain aliases to serve multiple brands or environments without repeating setup steps.
* **Consistent user experience**: Guarantee that every domain you control delivers the same secure, branded checkout flow.

# Key details

1. **Application name**

   * Enter a friendly name for your app or website (for example, `Demo`).

2. **Primary domain**

   * Provide the domain where your app lives (for example, `demo.recurlyengage.com`).
   * You don’t need to include subdomains like `www` unless you plan to host multiple applications under the same root domain.

3. **Domain aliases**

   * Aliases let you run multiple domains through one Recurly Engage configuration.
   * Perfect when you have several brands or testing environments pointing to the same backend.
