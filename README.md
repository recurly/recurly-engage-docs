## Readme.com Integration

### Previewing changes in readme's UI
In order to preview your branch in readme, the branch name must start with the target branch name followed by an underscore.

When making changes to the `v1.0` version of the docs, create a branch from the `v1.0` branch named `v1.0_<custom branch name>`.
